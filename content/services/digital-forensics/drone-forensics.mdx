## A Zorah Security Lab Overview

Drone forensics represents a critical frontier in digital investigations, focusing on the extraction of digital evidence from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) under forensically sound protocols. At Zorah Security Lab, our expertise extends beyond standard drones to encompass any remote-controlled UAV equipped with internal memory and communication systems, including cameras, WiFi, GPS, and cellular data links.

In modern criminal and civil investigations, drones have proven to be invaluable repositories of evidence. Our forensic examinations are designed to uncover crucial data that can establish wrongdoing or provide definitive leads. This includes a comprehensive analysis of flight routes, precise launch and landing coordinates, captured photographs and videos, operator identification, controller details, and associated metadata.

To address the growing threat of unauthorized or rogue drones, **Zorah Security Lab** has deployed an advanced, city-wide sensor network. This system identifies and monitors drone activity by detecting unique MAC addresses. This methodology allows us to track specific drones, map their flight paths, and gather actionable intelligence on operations near sensitive or protected zones.

Our monitoring platform is cloud-native, enabling smooth scalability from a single city to nationwide coverage. The system's mobility allows for rapid deployment in vehicles, ensuring adaptive protection for critical infrastructure and major events. By performing real-time analysis on the data collected by our sensors, we provide law enforcement and security organizations with the immediate intelligence needed to identify, track, and mitigate drone-related threats.

Zorah Security Lab stands at the forefront of this field, offering global capabilities in drone forensic examination and proactive aerial threat intelligence.
