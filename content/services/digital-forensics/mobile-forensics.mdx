**Computer Forensics & Examination –** Uncovering the Digital Truth

In a world where critical evidence is stored digitally, the ability to uncover it is paramount. Zorah Security Lab provides global digital forensics services, specializing in the meticulous recovery and analysis of data from computers, portable devices, and hard drives. We deliver the factual clarity required to resolve complex international disputes and investigations.

Our global team of certified experts investigates, analyzes, and recovers forensic data to the highest international standards. We ensure that no piece of digital evidence is overlooked, from active files to deleted data, internet history, emails, and photos. This comprehensive approach is vital for constructing an accurate and defensible timeline of events, anywhere in the world.

 

**Our forensic process is built on global standards of integrity and reliability**

We conduct every examination using a systematic and forensically sound methodology. This begins with the precise identification and secure acquisition of data, followed by a meticulous analysis, and culminates in a clear presentation of our findings. We maintain an unbroken chain of custody for all evidence, ensuring our discoveries are authoritative and admissible in legal proceedings across multiple jurisdictions.

 

**The critical evidence we uncover empowers your case**

Our analysts excel at uncovering hidden digital narratives. We recover deleted files, trace digital communications like emails, and interpret metadata—the hidden information that reveals when a file was created, modified, or accessed. This allows us to construct a reliable narrative and establish factual timelines that are often pivotal to an investigation.

 

**We assist clients worldwide in a wide range of sensitive situations, including**

- Internal     Corporate Investigations (employee misconduct, policy breaches)
- Cross-Border     Legal and Civil Litigation Support
- Fraud     and Financial Tampering Analysis
- Intellectual     Property Theft and Global Data Leak Investigations
- Cyber     Crime and International Espionage Incidents

At Zorah Security Lab, we operate on the principle that the truth resides in the data. Our global reach and deep technical expertise provide the capability to find it, analyze it, and present it with absolute certainty. We are ready to support your investigation anywhere in the world, regardless of the scale or location of your digital evidence.

Let Zorah Security Lab help you uncover the facts that lead to the truth.
