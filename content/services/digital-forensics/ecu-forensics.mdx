## Unlocking the Digital Truth

At Zorah Security Lab, we operate at the intersection of advanced automotive technology and digital forensics. Our specialized focus is on Engine Control Unit (ECU) forensics, a critical discipline dedicated to recovering vital digital evidence from the complex electronic systems within modern vehicles.

When an incident occurs, be it a serious collision, a crime involving a vehicle, or a case of suspected fraud, the vehicle’s own electronic modules often hold the definitive account. We are experts in extracting and interpreting that account.

 

### Our Core Forensic Capabilities

We recover essential data from a wide array of automotive modules, including

- Engine     Control Units (ECUs)
- Airbag     Control Modules (ACMs) and SRS Units
- Anti-lock     Braking System (ABS) Modules
- Transmission     Control Modules (TCMs)
- Instrument     Clusters (Dashboards)
- Infotainment     and Head-Up Units
- Electronic     Keys and Navigation Systems

The data we uncover provides undeniable insights. Our forensic experts specialize in the recovery of:

- **Vehicle     Identification Numbers (VIN) & Serial Numbers**

Including the critical recovery of deleted or tampered VIN and serial data for vehicle identification.

 

- **Kilometer     (KM) Readings**

We forensically determine the true mileage of a vehicle, even after attempted deletion or rollback.

 

- **Crash     Data & Event Histories**

We extract precise data related to a collision, including speed, braking, force of impact, and pre-crash vehicle behavior.

 

- **Mapping     & Engine Parameters**

Accessing stored data on engine tuning, performance modifications, and emission controls.

 

- **Historic     Fault Logs**

Retrieving a timeline of system faults, errors, and diagnostic codes, often stamped with time and mileage data.
