## Business Email Compromise Investigation (BEC)

Business Email Compromise (BEC) represents one of the most significant and increasing cyber threats facing global businesses today. This complex exploit involves criminals gaining unauthorized access to corporate email systems, impersonating executives or trusted partners, and planning fraudulent wire transfer requests. The financial impact is severe and immediate, with stolen funds often being rapidly routed to offshore locations, notably Hong Kong, before being dispersed further.

At Zorah Security Lab, we recognize the urgent need for a decisive and expert response to this growing crisis.

### Understanding the BEC Threat

BEC scams specifically target organizations that engage in frequent international wire transfers and maintain overseas suppliers. Companies with established business relationships in Asia and other offshore regions are at a heightened risk. These attacks are not merely technical breaches; they are carefully crafted campaigns of psychological manipulation, leveraging social engineering to deceive employees and executives into authorizing payments to fraudulent accounts.
