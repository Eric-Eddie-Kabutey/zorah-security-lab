At Zorah Security Lab, we operate as an international specialist team dedicated to the investigation and recovery of stolen vehicles worldwide. When a vehicle is stolen, time is critical. Our role is to provide immediate, global support to clients and authorities in the search and retrieval process.

## The Immediate Response Protocol

The first step following a theft is always to report the crime to the nearest police station. Once a report is filed, the police issue an international warrant based on the vehicle's VIN and license plate, officially listing it as wanted on international databases, including Interpol's SMV system. This is the crucial moment when you should engage **Zorah Security Lab** to begin our active search and operational support.

### Our Comprehensive Service Scope

Zorah Security Lab provides end-to-end operational support for the search and recovery of stolen assets, including cars, vans, trucks, motorcycles, and boats. As an international private organization, we work in support of Insurance companies and law enforcement agencies to investigate and combat vehicle crime across the globe, with operational reach in the USA, Europe, West Africa, and Asia.

Our mission consists of two core components:

- **Investigation.**     The expert tracing and locating of stolen vehicles.
- **Recovery.**     The secure reallocation of discovered vehicles to their rightful     owners.
