When a vehicle is stolen, time is the critical factor. **Zorah Security Lab** operates at the forefront of vehicle security, leveraging a direct, real-time connection to modern automobiles themselves to deliver a rapid and decisive response.

**Our Core Capability – Direct Access to the Vehicle**

Our flagship Stolen Vehicle Tracking platform (SMVIU) is an advanced operational hub. It functions as a multi-API data exchange center, establishing secure, real-time connections directly with vehicle manufacturers. This advanced integration allows us to acquire a vehicle's precise location and telematics data the moment an incident is reported.

This is not a standard GPS tracker installation, it is the activation of the vehicle's own built-in systems. This method enables telematics tracing for most vehicles manufactured from 2016 onwards.

**The Zorah Security Lab Recovery Process**

1. **Instant     Activation**

Once a vehicle is reported stolen to the SMVIU platform, our process is initiated immediately.

 

1. **Real-Time     Location Intelligence**

Our platform bridges the gap between law enforcement, insurers, and vehicle manufacturers, pulling live location data directly from the vehicle.

 

1. **Active     Deployment**

The moment a location is confirmed, our dedicated Active Search Team (AST) is deployed to the coordinates to retrieve the vehicle.
